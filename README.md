🥔 Potato Disease Classification
📌 Overview
This project focuses on detecting and classifying diseases in potato plants using deep learning models. The model is trained on a dataset of potato plant images and can classify images into different disease categories.

🌱 Dataset
The dataset consists of images of potato leaves classified into different categories:

Healthy

Early Blight

Late Blight

🏗️ Model Implementation
The model is built using TensorFlow/Keras and trained on an image dataset. The saved model (potatoes.h5) is used for classification in different environments such as mobile, web, and cloud deployment.

Deploy the Model
API Deployment: The api/ folder contains a Flask API to serve the model.

Web Interface: The frontend/ folder can be used to integrate a UI for users.
